# Employee Tracker

## Description

I wanted to create an application that would store data in a remote server rather than a local file. This project helped me to hone my skills using MySQL2 and incorporate another package such as inquirer to build a real-world application.  The application can be used by businesses to keep track of an employee data base, assigning various identifiers to each employee. There were several challenges associated with this project. As i became more comfortable with modularization, I was able to seperate program functions to increase code readability. I ran into trouble when trying to include recursive functions to re-initiate the prompt questions. Learning how to incorporate promise chains in multiple ways, allowed me to prevent any code overwriting due to processing lag.

## Installation

- Enter "npm install" in the terminal to download the necessary dependencies. Then you will need to run the schema.sql and seeds.sql by using the "source" command before each file. Once both of these steps have been completed, you can initiate the program by entering "npm start".
